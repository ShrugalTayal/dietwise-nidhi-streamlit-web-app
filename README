**README: NutriWise-Nidhi**

Welcome to NutriWise-Nidhi! This README provides comprehensive guidance on maintaining dependencies for your project using the `pipreqs` tool, as well as setting up a Git repository for effective version control and collaboration.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python: Download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Git: Install Git from the official website: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- GitHub Account: Create an account on GitHub if you don't have one: https://github.com/

## Maintaining Dependencies

### Installing `pipreqs`

`pipreqs` is a powerful tool for managing project dependencies. To install it, follow these steps:

```bash
pip install pipreqs
```

### Generating and Updating Dependencies

To generate and update your project's dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your project's root directory using the terminal.

2. Generate or update the `requirements.txt` file with the command:

```bash
pipreqs .
```

3. Review the generated `requirements.txt` file to ensure it accurately represents your project's dependencies.

### Installing Dependencies

Install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Updating Dependencies

As your project evolves, you may need to add new dependencies or update existing ones. To update the `requirements.txt` file, follow these steps:

1. Install or update the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install package-name
```

2. Regenerate the `requirements.txt` file to reflect the changes:

```bash
pipreqs --encoding=utf8
```

## Git Setup

Setting up a Git repository is crucial for efficient collaboration and version control.

### Initializing Git Repository

Follow these steps to set up your Git repository:

1. Generate a `requirements.txt` file using the steps mentioned above.

2. Initialize a Git repository in your project's root directory:

```bash
git init
```

3. Add your project files to the repository:

```bash
git add .
```

4. Commit your changes with a meaningful comment:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Project setup"
```

5. Create a remote repository on GitHub and link it to your local repository:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<UserName>/<repo-name>.git
```

6. Push your committed changes to the remote repository:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```
