### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Installing `pipreqs`
This section provides instructions on how to maintain dependencies for your project using the `pipreqs` tool. 

To generate a list of dependencies for your project, you can use the `pipreqs` tool. This tool scans your project's source code and creates a `requirements.txt` file containing the list of dependencies required by your project.

To install `pipreqs`, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install pipreqs
```

### Generating and Updating Dependencies

1. Navigate to the root directory of your project using the terminal.

2. Run the following command to generate/update the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pipreqs .
```

This command scans the current directory and its subdirectories for import statements in your Python source code and generates a `requirements.txt` file with the detected dependencies.

3. Review the generated `requirements.txt` file to ensure that it includes all the necessary dependencies for your project.

### Installing Dependencies

To install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all the required packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Updating Dependencies

As your project evolves, you might need to add new dependencies or update existing ones. To update the `requirements.txt` file, you can follow these steps:

1. Install or update the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install package-name
```

2. After installing or updating packages, regenerate the `requirements.txt` file using `pipreqs`:

```bash
pipreqs --encoding=utf8
```

### Conclusion

Maintaining project dependencies is essential for ensuring the stability and functionality of your project. By following the steps outlined in this README, you can easily generate and update the `requirements.txt` file to keep track of your project's dependencies.

Remember to regularly review and update your dependencies to ensure that your project remains up-to-date and secure.
