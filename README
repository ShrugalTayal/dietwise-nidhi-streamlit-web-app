# Maintaining Dependencies

## Installing `pipreqs`
This section provides instructions on how to maintain dependencies for your project using the `pipreqs` tool. 

To generate a list of dependencies for your project, you can use the `pipreqs` tool. This tool scans your project's source code and creates a `requirements.txt` file containing the list of dependencies required by your project.

To install `pipreqs`, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install pipreqs
```

## Generating and Updating Dependencies

1. Navigate to the root directory of your project using the terminal.

2. Run the following command to generate/update the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pipreqs .
```

This command scans the current directory and its subdirectories for import statements in your Python source code and generates a `requirements.txt` file with the detected dependencies.

3. Review the generated `requirements.txt` file to ensure that it includes all the necessary dependencies for your project.

## Installing Dependencies

To install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all the required packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Updating Dependencies

As your project evolves, you might need to add new dependencies or update existing ones. To update the `requirements.txt` file, you can follow these steps:

1. Install or update the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install package-name
```

2. After installing or updating packages, regenerate the `requirements.txt` file using `pipreqs`:

```bash
pipreqs --encoding=utf8
```

## Conclusion

Maintaining project dependencies is essential for ensuring the stability and functionality of your project. By following the steps outlined in this README, you can easily generate and update the `requirements.txt` file to keep track of your project's dependencies.

Remember to regularly review and update your dependencies to ensure that your project remains up-to-date and secure.

# Git Setup

This section provides a simple guide on setting up a Git repository for your project. Follow these steps to initialize a Git repository, add your project files, and push them to a remote GitHub repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Git installed: Download and install Git from the official website: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- GitHub account: Create a GitHub account if you don't have one: https://github.com/

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Generate Requirements File**:

    Before setting up your Git repository, it's a good practice to generate a `requirements.txt` file to track project dependencies. You can use the `pipreqs` tool for this purpose:

    ```bash
    pipreqs --encoding=utf8
    ```

2. **Initialize Git Repository**:

    Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project's root directory. Run the following commands to initialize a Git repository:

    ```bash
    git init
    ```

3. **Add Project Files**:

    Add all your project files to the Git repository using the following command:

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

4. **Commit Changes**:

    Commit the added files to the repository with a meaningful comment. Replace `<insert comments>` with a brief description of your changes:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "<insert comments>"
    ```

5. **Link to Remote Repository**:

    Create a remote repository on GitHub. Replace `<UserName>` with your GitHub username and `<repo-name>` with the name of your repository.

    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/<UserName>/<repo-name>.git
    ```

6. **Push to GitHub**:

    Push your committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub. This command will set the default remote branch to `master`.

    ```bash
    git push -u origin master
    ```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully set up a Git repository for your project and pushed your files to a remote GitHub repository. From now on, you can continue to add, modify, and commit your project files, and then push those changes to GitHub to collaborate with others or to keep your work organized.

Remember to regularly update your repository by committing and pushing changes as your project progresses. If you need further assistance with Git commands or GitHub features, refer to their documentation or online resources.
